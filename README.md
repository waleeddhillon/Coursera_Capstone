# Report
# 1) Introduction/Business Problem
Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.
The main reason of this project is to help people who are planning to open a restaurant in the Toronto area. This study provides data about the competitors, population and income in different neighborhoods in Toronto
# 2) Downloading and Prepping Data
Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.
# In order to provide the necessary data for this study I have used the population and the average income per neighborhood from Toronto’s 2016 Census. This information then has been combined with Foursquare API and Toronto’s neighborhood shape file to store data on competitors within the same area.
# Links available to this data are listed below:
# Toronto Neighborhoods' shape file https://open.toronto.ca/catalogue/?sort=last_refreshed%20desc
# Toronto's Census 2016 https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/wellbeing-toronto-demographics/
# 3) Methodology
Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.
# In this report I have used various maps to help an individual/investor better decide in which neighborhood to open a new restaurant based on population, income and competition. In order to originate these maps, I used data from Foursquare to display the restaurants in the neighborhoods currently and used Toronto’s Census 2016 combined with choropleth to determine the population and income in each region

# 4) Results
Results section where you discuss the results.
# As you can notice on the maps majority of the restaurants are located on the south side and main streets of Toronto. We can also see that most of the high income neighborhoods are located up north. It was also noticed that a more population in an area did not reflect upon the number of restaurants in the area.
# 5) Discussion
Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.
# At the beginning of this project I was expecting to find clusters of restaurants in different locations of Toronto and in the end the results did not meet my hypothesis.
# 6) Conclusion
Conclusion section where you conclude the report.
# In conclusion, this study can be useful for investors who are looking to open a new restaurant in Toronto by comparing different neighborhood profiles based on income, population and competition. This study only use’s a few variables to conduct research so it does not cover all variables that may also need to be taken into consideration therefore this study can not be used as a single decision making tool for an individual/investor.
